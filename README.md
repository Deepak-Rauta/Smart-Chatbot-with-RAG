# Smart-Chatbot-with-RAG


Main Motive of This Project 🚀

The goal of this project is to build a Smart Q&A Chatbot that can answer user queries using two different approaches:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 🧠

The chatbot first searches for relevant information in a vector database (FAISS) that contains pre-stored knowledge.

If the answer is found in the internal database, it returns a well-informed response using a retrieval-based method.

Web Search via Agents 🌍

If the chatbot does not find a good answer in its knowledge base, it automatically searches the web using Tavily (AI-powered web search API).

This makes the chatbot more dynamic and capable of answering questions about real-time or external data.
